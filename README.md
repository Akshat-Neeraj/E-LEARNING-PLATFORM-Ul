I have created a E-Learning Platform in which it mainly have three pages- "Home" which contains the introduction about EduHub, some popular courses of EduHub, some reviews of some students about courses present in EduHub, "Courses" page which contains all the available courses which contains "Watch Now" button with rating of the courses, "About Us" page which contains information of EduHub and a "Contact Us" part in which user can send feedback to the developer of EduHub and in footer side I have use "&copy" to make a copyright sign which represents that this webpage is create in 2025 by EduHub. I have created a login/ sign up page in which a user can login with an email id and password if the user does not have an account then he/she can create it by clicking on the the Sign up link and then user can put his/her email, username and password. And if a user like me who always forgots his/her password then he/she can click on the Forgot Password button and then he/she can recieve the password through email that he/she put on the email. In "Courses" page it have eight courses which are- Front-End Web Development, Data Science with Python, Introduction to Machine Learning, Mobile App Development, Cloud Computing Essentials, DevOps Practices. And when someone wants to learn a course, for example a user wants to learn "Cybersecurity Essentials" then he/she will have to click on "Watch Now" and then it will redirect it to the page of Cybersecurity page in which it contains a youtube video under this it have course curriculam which are the topics that are present in the youtube video and it also have a feature of progress tracking in which I have used "fas fa-circle" to make it like a tick the box thing and it is connected with local storage which can help as a bookmark to the user that user has completed that part and will continue to the next part. And below it a short note about the lecturer or the person who has createed that course is there.
